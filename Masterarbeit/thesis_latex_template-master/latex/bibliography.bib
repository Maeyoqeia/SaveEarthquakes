	abstract = {Magnitude estimation is a central task in seismology needed for a wide spectrum of applications ranging from seismicity analysis to rapid assessment of earthquakes. However, magnitude estimates at individual stations show significant variability, mostly due to propagation effects, radiation pattern and ambient noise. To obtain reliable and precise magnitude estimates, measurements from multiple stations are therefore usually averaged. This strategy requires good data availability, which is not always given, for example for near real time applications or for small events. We developed a method to achieve precise magnitude estimations even in the presence of only few stations. We achieve this by reducing the variability between single station estimates through a combination of optimization and machine learning techniques on a large catalogue. We evaluate our method on the large scale IPOC catalogue with {\textgreater}100 000 events, covering seismicity in the northern Chile subduction zone between 2007 and 2014. Our aim is to create a method that provides low uncertainty magnitude estimates based on physically meaningful features. Therefore we combine physics based correction functions with boosting tree regression. In a first step, we extract 110 features from each waveform, including displacement, velocity, acceleration and cumulative energy features. We correct those features for source, station and path effects by imposing a linear relation between magnitude and the logarithm of the features. For the correction terms, we define a non-parametric correction function dependent on epicentral distance and event depth and a station specific, adaptive 3-D source and path correction function. In a final step, we use boosting tree regression to further reduce interstation variance by combining multiple features. Compared to a standard, non-parametric, 1-D correction function, our method reduces the standard deviation of single station estimates by up to 57 percent of which 1 percent can be attributed to the improved correction functions, while boosting tree regression gives a further reduction of 40 percent. We analyse the resulting magnitude estimates regarding their residuals and relation to each other. The definition of a physics-based correction function enables us to inspect the path corrections and compare them to structural features. By analysing feature importance, we show that envelope and P wave derived features are key parameters for reducing uncertainties. Nonetheless the variety of features is essential for the effectiveness of the boosting tree regression. To further elucidate the information extractable from a single station trace, we train another boosting tree on the uncorrected features. This regression yields magnitude estimates with uncertainties similar to the single features after correction, but without using the earthquake location as required for applying the correction terms. Finally, we use our results to provide high precision magnitudes and their uncertainties for the IPOC catalogue.},

	abstract = {As the number of seismic sensors grows, it is becoming increasingly difficult for analysts to pick seismic phases manually and comprehensively, yet such efforts are fundamental to earthquake monitoring. Despite years of improvements in automatic phase picking, it is difficult to match the performance of experienced analysts. A more subtle issue is that different seismic analysts may pick phases differently, which can introduce bias into earthquake locations. We present a deep-neural-network-based arrival-time picking method called "PhaseNet" that picks the arrival times of both P and S waves. Deep neural networks have recently made rapid progress in feature learning, and with sufficient training, have achieved super-human performance in many applications. PhaseNet uses three-component seismic waveforms as input and generates probability distributions of P arrivals, S arrivals and noise as output. We engineer PhaseNet such that peaks in the probability distributions provide accurate arrival times for both P and S waves. PhaseNet is trained on the prodigious available data set provided by analyst-labelled P and S arrival times from the Northern California Earthquake Data Center. The data set we use contains more than 700 000 waveform samples extracted from over 30 yr of earthquake recordings. We demonstrate that PhaseNet achieves much higher picking accuracy and recall rate than existing methods when applied to the waveforms of known earthquakes, which has the potential to increase the number of S-wave observations dramatically over what is currently available. This will enable both improved locations and improved shear wave velocity models.},

	abstract = {Effective early warning, emergency response, and information dissemination for earthquakes and tsunamis require rapid characterization of an earthquake's location, size, and other parameters, usually provided by real-time seismogram analysis using established, rule-based, seismological procedures. Powerful, new machine learning (ML) tools analyze basic data using little or no rule-based knowledge, and an ML deep convolutional neural network (CNN) can operate directly on seismogram waveforms with little preprocessing and without feature extraction. How a CNN will perform for rapid automated earthquake detection and characterization using short singlestation waveforms is an issue of fundamental importance for earthquake monitoring. For an initial investigation of this issue, we adapt an existing CNN for local earthquake detection and epicentral classification using single-station waveforms (Perol et al., 2018), to form a new CNN, ConvNetQuake{\_}INGV, to characterize earthquakes at any distance (local to far-teleseismic). ConvNetQuake{\_}INGV operates directly on 50-s three-component broadband single-station waveforms to detect seismic events and obtain binned probabilistic estimates of the distance, azimuth, depth, and magnitude of the event. The best performance of ConvNetQuake{\_}INGV is obtained using a last convolutional layer with fewer nodes than the number of output classifications, a form of information bottleneck. We show that ConvNetQuake{\_}INGV detects very well (accuracy 87{\%}) and characterizes moderately well earthquakes over a broad range of distances and magnitudes, and we analyze outlier results and indications of overfitting of the CNN training data.We find weak evidence that the CNNis performing more than high-dimensional regression and pattern recognition, and is generalizing information or learning, to provide useful characterization of new events not represented in the training data. We expect that real-time ML procedures such as ConvNetQuake{\_}INGV, perhaps incorporating rule-based knowledge, will ultimately prove valuable for rapid detection and characterization of earthquakes for earthquake response and tsunami early warning.},

We use a multi-task temporal-convolutional neural network to learn epicentral distance and P travel time from 1-minute seismograms. The network estimates epicentral distance and P travel time with absolute mean errors of 0.23 km and 0.03 s respectively, along with their epistemic and aleatory uncertainties. We design a separate multi-input network using standard convolutional layers to estimate the back-azimuth angle, and its epistemic uncertainty. This network estimates the direction from which seismic waves arrive to the station with a mean error of 1 degree. Using this information, we estimate the epicenter, origin time, and depth along with their confidence intervals. We use a global dataset of earthquake signals recorded within 1 degree ({\~{}}112 km) from the event to build the model and to demonstrate its performance. Our model can predict epicenter, origin time, and depth with mean errors of 7.3 km, 0.4 second, and 6.7 km respectively, at different locations around the world.

	abstract = {Precise real time estimates of earthquake magnitude and location are essential for early warning and rapid response. While recently multiple deep learning approaches for fast assessment of earthquakes have been proposed, they usually rely on either seismic records from a single station or from a fixed set of seismic stations. Here we introduce a new model for real-time magnitude and location estimation using the attention based transformer networks. Our approach incorporates waveforms from a dynamically varying set of stations and outperforms deep learning baselines in both magnitude and location estimation performance. Furthermore, it outperforms a classical magnitude estimation algorithm considerably and shows promising performance in comparison to a classical localization algorithm. In this work, we furthermore conduct a comprehensive study of the requirements on training data, the training procedures and the typical failure modes using three diverse and large scale data sets. Our analysis gives several key insights. First, we can precisely pinpoint the effect of large training data; for example, a four times larger training set reduces the required time for real time assessment by a factor of four. Second, the basic model systematically underestimates large magnitude events. This issue can be mitigated by incorporating events from other regions into the training through transfer learning. Third, location estimation is highly precise in areas with sufficient training data, but is strongly degraded for events outside the training distribution. Our analysis suggests that these characteristics are not only present for our model, but for most deep learning models for fast assessment published so far. They result from the black box modeling and their mitigation will likely require imposing physics derived constraints on the neural network.},

	abstract = {To optimally monitor earthquake-generating processes, seismologists have sought to lower detection sensitivities ever since instrumental seismic networks were started about a century ago. Recently, it has become possible to search continuous waveform archives for replicas of previously recorded events (i.e., template matching), which has led to at least an order of magnitude increase in the number of detected earthquakes and greatly sharpened our view of geological structures. Earthquake catalogs produced in this fashion, however, are heavily biased in that they are completely blind to events for which no templates are available, such as in previously quiet regions or for very large-magnitude events. Here, we show that with deep learning, we can overcome such biases without sacrificing detection sensitivity. We trained a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) on the vast hand-labeled data archives of the Southern California Seismic Network to detect seismic body-wave phases. We show that the ConvNet is extremely sensitive and robust in detecting phases even when masked by high background noise and when the ConvNet is applied to new data that are not represented in the training set (in particular, very largemagnitude events). This generalized phase detection framework will significantly improve earthquake monitoring and catalogs, which form the underlying basis for a wide range of basic and applied seismological research.},

The earthquake size can be therefore estimated using only a couple of seconds of signal from the P- or S-wave onsets, i.e, while the rupture itself is still propagating and rupture dimension is far from complete. We argue that dynamic stress release and/or slip duration on the fault in the very early stage of seismic fracture, scales both with the observed peak amplitude and with the elastic energy available for fracture propagation. The probability that a fracture grows to a larger size should scale with the energy initially available. Copyright 2006 by the American Geophysical Union.},
